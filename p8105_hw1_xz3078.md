# Problem 1

``` r
x = rnorm(10)
df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = x,
  vec_logical = x > 0,
  vec_char = c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Group1", "Group1", "Group3", "Group2", "Group1", "Group3", "Group2", "Group2", "Group3", "Group2"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    vec_numeric vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1      0.0174 TRUE        One      Group1    
    ##  2     -0.928  FALSE       Two      Group1    
    ##  3     -0.778  FALSE       Three    Group3    
    ##  4      0.464  TRUE        Four     Group2    
    ##  5      0.510  TRUE        Five     Group1    
    ##  6      0.213  TRUE        Six      Group3    
    ##  7      0.635  TRUE        Seven    Group2    
    ##  8      0.627  TRUE        Eight    Group2    
    ##  9      0.672  TRUE        Nine     Group3    
    ## 10     -0.656  FALSE       Ten      Group2

``` r
num = pull(df, vec_numeric)
mean(num)
```

    ## [1] 0.07745351

``` r
logical = pull(df, vec_logical)
mean(logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
char = pull(df, vec_char)
mean(char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(char): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
fac = pull(df, vec_factor)
mean(fac)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fac): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean works for numeric variables and logical variables, but doesnâ€™t
work for character variables or factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(logical)
as.numeric(char)
as.numeric(fac)
```

Logical variables can be converted into 0 and 1 because logical
variables contain values of either TRUE or FALSE. 3-level factor
variable can be converted into 1, 2, and 3 because factor variables
separate unique values into levels. Therefore, factor variables can be
converted into numeric variables based on levels. However, character
variables cannot be converted into numeric variables because character
variables are sets of text strings. We can only take the mean of numeric
or logical variables. Although factor variables can be converted into
numeric variables, we cannot directly take the mean of a factor
variable.

# Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

In the penguins dataset, the variable names are species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
sex, year. There are 3 levels under factor species, which are Adelie,
Chinstrap, Gentoo. There are 3 levels under factor island, which are
Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen. The year are 2007, 2008, 2009. The dataset has
344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is 200.9152047mm.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```
